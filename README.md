# Optimal Flight Path under Jet Streams

This repository is a "just for fun"-project that aims to compute the time-minimizing flight paths given jet streams.

Computing the time-minizming the path between two points on a sphere corresponds to finding the geodesics on a sphere, which have a well-known closed-form expression. However, if a flight is moving under the influence of a jet stream, simply computing geodesics will not the time-minimizing paths. This repository computes the time minimizing flight path between two points given a jet stream by computing geodesics under a time-dependent Finsler metric. We consider the Riemannian background metric induced by the WGS48 Earth Model corresponding to an ellipsoid, and a time-dependent force field acting on the earth model corresponding to the jet stream. Under certain regularity this can be seen as a time-dependent Finsler metric following the work of [1].

Geodesics under a time-dependent Finsler metric can be found using the algorithm prooposed in [2]. In the special case that the force field is zero, or is not time-dependent this corresponds to the algorithm in [3].

## Installation

The code can be setup using the environment env.yaml.

conda env create -f env.yaml
conda activate flight_model

## Future work

In the current version the optimal flight path can be found without a jet stream or with a static jet stream. Future work can include:
* Constructing a model that estimates the time evolution of the jet stream. This can be added directly to the code as is.
* Incorporating constraints into the model, e.g., places where it is not allowed to fly

## Disclaimer

The model is a simple representation of computing optimal flight paths given jet streams and furhter investigation of the method and other considerations are needed to ensure that this is indeed the time-minimizing flight path.
